# Summary  

This lesson brings us to the end of our discussion on the core principles of **object-
oriented programming**. In this lesson, we have looked at *data types, algorithms, and
strings*.We've seen how an array is an ordered collection of items of the same type.  

* **Arrays** are declared with square brackets, [ ],and their size cannot be modified.  

* **Java** provides the Arrays class from the collections framework that has extra methods we can use on arrays.  

* We also saw the concept of **Arraylist** and **string**.

* Java provides the **StringBuilder** class,which is basically a *modifiable string*.  

* **Stringbuilder** has length and capacity functions.
