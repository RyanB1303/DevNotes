# Java Array Methods Explanation

## **Arrays.sort()**  
uses an algorithm called double-pivot quicksort to sort large
arrays. For smaller arrays, it uses a combination of *Insertion sort* and *Merge sort*.
It is better to trust that Arrays.sort() is <mark>optimized</mark> to each use case instead
of implementing your own sorting algorithm. 
## **Arrays.binarySearch()**  
uses an algorithm called *binary search* to look for an item in the array. 
It first requires that the array be sorted, and that is why we called Arrays.sort() first. 
Binary search splits the sorted array into two equal halves recursively until it can no longer divide the array, at which point that value is the answer.
